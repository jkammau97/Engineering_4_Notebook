I got involved in Holy Comforter Catholic Church's choir about two years ago after rediscovering the beauty of the catholic faith and wanting to learn how
to sing. One of the biggest ways that I've served them so far was with their 2nd Annual Lessons and Carols Concert, which had to be totally reworked into
an outside concert due to the pandemic. In addition to being 1 of 3 bass voices, I recruited 9 other high school wind players from around the area to form
a mini wind ensemble to replace the church organ outdoors, transcribed and arranged ~15 choir and piano scores to fit the instrumentation, and
coordinated 4 rehearsals for them to get ready to perform. With this concert, we gave the Cville community high quality, live ensemble music, while also
giving the singers and musicians a chance to make music together for the first time in 9 months. This event gave me very good experience organizing and
leading people, and gave everyone involved extreme joy when it was most needed.
