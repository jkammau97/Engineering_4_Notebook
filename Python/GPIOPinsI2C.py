# Code for GPIO Pins - I2C
# 1/13/22
# Write a new program by combining the two example scripts you have already used.
# Mash these two programs together so that the X, Y, and Z accelerations measured by your accelerometer are displayed on your little OLED display. 
# And convert and scale the values to m/s2, rounded to two or three decimal places.  
# So, when it's just sitting flat on the table, the z-acceleration should be roughly 9.81 m/s2.

# Simple demo of of the LSM303 accelerometer & magnetometer library.
# Will print the accelerometer & magnetometer X, Y, Z axis values every half
# second.
